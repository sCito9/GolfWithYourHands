## how to play
Create new course:
    enter a course name, place a start and a finish. Then validate your course and finally upload it to enjoy it with others

Create new game:
    choose between max 2-4 players (you can always start early), choose a course and create a lobby

Gameplay:
    double klick on your own ball to enter the free cam and spectate where you want to hit  
    to hit your ball, first hold the green circle, then press anywhere on the screen, the lower you press, the harder the power  
    look at the arrow for directions towards the hole  
    beware of holes all around the map and make sure to only fall into the right one :), if you fall into the wrong one, just wait, the game will reset you.         (Alternatively you can type ResetPosition, to speed up the process)
    if something does go wrong and the turn doesnt advance, you can type AdvanceTurnManually  
    if something goes horribly wrong (or you want to ragequit) type QuitGame to return to the MainMenu  
    after the game has finished you can invite people to be your friends or to join your club, to accept follow the instructions on the console  

Chatting:
    in a multiplayer game you can chat with your opponents by typing into the console. Use it like this: m [Your message]  
    in the club menu you can do the same, IMPORTANT: here you have to use c [Your message]  

Clubs:
    you can join a club by ID or create a new one  
    play against other clubs during a club battle, try to get the best score possible on the 3 random maps.  


# important information:
as it was a simple university project, we have shut down our data server, so the game is currently not playable. If you want to play the game, you have to manually launch the server (the server code is provided in the server folder) and then change the BaseUrl manually in the RemoteBackend.cs class.
